					"description": "The practice of product management has evolved massively in the last 10-15 years. During that time, companies have learned how to use a lean roadmap to communicate strategy, and have learned how to adapt their plans to produce the best possible outcomes for their stakeholders.\n\nWhile product management practices are classically applied to development of software products, this presentation will outline how a roadmap can be used to communicate any business priorities and ensure everyone understands how to contribute to company success.\n\nUp until recently, no one really knew what roadmaps were supposed to look like and in some cases, roadmaps were deemed to be unusable or unhelpful. Today, roadmapping is a contentious subject but at least one thing is self-evident: no one reads a roadmap they can’t understand.\n\nWe’re also discovering how powerful it is when a roadmap is so clearly designed that companies put it at the center of their business decisions.\n\nWe’re seeing how a roadmap can bridge your work with everyone else’s and put you back in control of your plans. But how do you create that roadmap?\n\nIn this presentation, we’ll see how to use a lean roadmap to clearly communicate high-level priorities\n\n– What is a lean roadmap, and why should we use one?\n– How can we link our roadmap back to company OKRs?\n– What kinds of activities can be communicated on a roadmap? Is it just for software development (hint: the answer is no!)\n– How can we use a roadmap to learn and adapt?\n– Why should we concentrate on outcome over output?\n\nAfter attending this presentation, you will be better equipped to communicate your company, department or team’s plans to the rest of the business, and have an increase chance of succeeding in your efforts to provide value. These concepts are applicable to all, whether you are developing a product, rolling out a new solution, planning sales &amp; marketing efforts or building a regulatory submission.\n",

This session has been run extensively in a large complex organisation as part of the ‘why’ proposition for increasing engagement and understanding for their move to agile. It is an effective method to help kickstart an organisations understanding and mindset on the value of Agile transformation. The session is designed for people who are new to Agile so if you’re looking for a new and creative way to land the message in your organisation, come and join us, play and take the take this session away with you. We will share the pack and train the trainer notes with anybody who is interested in re-using this workshop.\n\nPlagiarise at will!!\n\nIt helps people understand complexity in either small or large organisations.\n",

					"description": "Security isn’t very fun for development teams to think about. It’s complex and something that isn’t brought to mind when considering requirements. Too often, it neglected by teams and left to the end for penetration testers to consider. But, it doesn’t have to be. Security can be considered early in the development cycle. How can we encourage this behaviour? How can you get development teams interested?\n\nSecurity is an important skill to possess while delivering quality software. The cost of not having security skills within teams is now more obvious than ever. Security should be in the forefront of development teams minds. Even with these risks, data leaks and denial of service attacks are in the headlines often. How do we stop our companies being another statistic?\n\nLearning should not be compulsory. Especially if you want something to become part of the culture. Beginning with a simple workshop to expanding to a security guild, people were eager to be involved. This lead to further workshops which included the basics of threat modelling using STRIDE to the complexity of automated checks. Security at Sky became not only fun but cool. Security was no longer a rarely thought about requirement but a fun, oft thought about need.",

					"description": "It’s very likely that the majority of the software architecture diagrams you’ve seen are a confused mess of boxes and lines. Following the publication of the Manifesto for Agile Software Development in 2001, teams have abandoned UML, discarded the concept of modelling and instead place a heavy reliance on conversations centered around incoherent whiteboard diagrams or shallow “Marketecture” diagrams created with Visio. Moving fast and being Agile requires good communication, yet software development teams struggle with this fundamental skill. A good set of software architecture diagrams are priceless for aligning a team around a shared vision and for getting new-joiners productive fast.\n\nThis session explores the visual communication of software architecture and is based upon a decade of Simon’s experiences working with software development teams large and small across the globe. He’ll look at what is commonplace today, the importance of creating a shared vocabulary, diagram notation, and the value of creating a lightweight model to describe your software system using the “C4 model”, which he created as a way to help software development teams describe and communicate software architecture, both during up-front design sessions and when retrospectively documenting an existing codebase.",

Well that’s not the true story.\n\nWhat good testing looks like is one of the most misunderstood areas of software development. Sadly not only do those outside of the testing industry often misunderstand what good looks like, so do those within testing as well. As tools vendors and service companies push their own agenda’s and universities push out more and more graduates with little formal education in testing then it’s no surprise that the sorts of testing typically talked about at agile conferences is not the sort of testing that fits with the autonomous, cross functional teams that we seek to build. If you’ve seen testers as the blockers to the team’s delivery or the quality police then you’ll no doubt understand why change is needed.\n\nFortunately there is light at the end of the tunnel. There is another way. And in this presentation we intend to tell the audience what that is. We will talk about how testing has come to be where it is today, what bad and ugly testing looks like and more importantly what good testing is. We’ll give the audience the information to take back to their teams to really be able to help their testers excel at their craft and ensure that they are a key part of every Agile team.

You have to work within the unique circumstances of your organisation. You’re constantly surrounded by strange problems, half-baked theories, off the shelf solutions that just don’t work, and people telling you they’ve worked here for 23 years and Amazon is nothing to worry about.\n\nHow do you identify and remove the major impediments in your build, testing, and operational activities? How do you avoid spending weeks, months, or years on far-reaching changes that ultimately have no impact on your time to market?\nThe Theory of Constraints is a management paradigm that describes how to improve throughput in a homogeneous workflow. It can be applied to Continuous Delivery in order to locate, prioritise, and reduce constrained activities until a flow of release candidates to production is achieved.\n\nIn this talk, Steve Smith will explain how easy it is for a Continuous Delivery programme to be unsuccessful, how the Theory Of Constraints works, how to apply the Five Focussing Steps to Continuous Delivery, and how to home in on the constrained activities that are your keys to success. It includes tales of glorious failures and ignominious successes when adopting Continuous Delivery.",

Developing software is a social enterprise and Agile has brought about many great techniques and tools to work better together, but some concepts such as “fail fast, fail often” or “just in time planning” can be challenging for certain personality types to fully endorsed. Similarly, many every day Agile practices rely on high level of extraversion. But what happens to those who are rather introverted and do not quite fit with the culture shift that Agile brought to the workplace?\n\nIn this multidisciplinary talk, we will draw from personality psychology and evolutionary biology to shed some lights into why we behave the way we do and why the agile mindset might be either easier or harder to adopt for certain personality types. We’ll also investigate how the balance between planning ahead and embracing uncertainty has deep biological roots into how we evolved as a species, and how this influences how we ought to shape software development projects to be aligned with our psychological substructure as human beings. Finally, we’ll cover a few strategies we can apply to help us deal with stress and how we can improve the way we learn and reduce risks in agile projects to build the “right thing” as well as the “thing right”.",

					"description": "For years Matt Kleiman’s Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) and other learning disabilities deterred his success on traditional software development teams. Working alone, on globally distributed teams, and on amorphous tasks, Matt found himself struggling to meet the expectations of a software engineer. In an endless showdown against distractions, Matt almost gave up on his career.\n\nThis is the story of how Pivotal Labs’ Extreme Programming practices empowered Matt. Pair programming provides Matt with a feedback loop for his thoughts and a partner to hold him accountable eight hours a day. Test driven development provides him with a disciplined structure for operating and is the perfect counterweight to inevitable distractions. Matt’s journey has taught him why it’s so important to work in ways that allow individuals to flourish and for us to have empathy for the learning styles of our peers.",

					"description": "Between 2015 and 2016, over 130,000 asylum seekers requested asylum in Austria – taking the country of 8.7 million people completely by surprise. As politicians were reluctant to act, civil society jumped in and founded hundreds of grassroots initiatives and projects intended to alleviate the integration process into Austrian society. However, seeing as there was no central coordination, high language barriers and little marketing budget, there was a missing link between the thousands of interested refugees and the surplus of offers by civil society. This is where “I am Refugee“ stepped in – our non-political, online platform that holistically depicts the user journey of a refugee on his path to integration in Austrian society.\n\nIn this talk, Stephanie will tell you about how they went from domain name to wireframes to a registered society and an up-and-running website within just 4 months. How they gained and integrated our users’ feedback to grow their product portfolio from a multilingual website to social media channels, an Android App and now even Google courses and workshops. Stephanie will show you how a strong vision, transparency, team work, iterations and pull principle are the best mechanisms for managing and leading an intercultural team of volunteers with different motives for over 18 months. You will hear about their main impediments ranging from governmental funding to trolling due to disapproval from the far-right.\n\nMost importantly, this talk should not only show you how Agile methods are great for starting a successful initiative in a low-to zero-budget sector, but how the Agile mindset behind a product and its focus on empowerment can be the most valuable addition to an entire sector.",

With judges saying “it’s rare to see Agile implemented so well, especially in the public sector”.\n\nScott will take attendees on an entertaining – warts and all – journey through the rollout, sharing invaluable lessons learned along the way.\n\nYou’ll discover how the team engaged with users to understand their needs and built the product’s content, navigation and design around those needs using a modern Agile approach for prioritisation, user testing, running workshops and delivery of an early minimum viable product (MVP).\n\nThis is a powerful case study that shows how empowered digital teams within an organisation, free from the restraints of complex corporate governance and process can flourish, delight users and deliver measurable value.\n\nThe success of the platform was by no means guaranteed in a fast-moving hierarchical organisation of 7,000 employees with very different needs, many of whom have very little trust in technology.\n\nThe session will cover:\n\nHow you can use agile principles for product and content rollout to reduce risk and delight users\nHow to identify and prioritise top tasks for a complex, ever-changing organisation\nHow to get out of project-based thinking and into product-based thinking, a key element for ongoing success",

				"bio": "Andy Eley is an Agile coach, educator, facilitator and leader who is passionate about helping teams enjoy their work and create delightful products. He currently works at JP Morgan in Glasgow with technical and non technical teams, but has spent time coaching in many different industries.\n\nAgile started off as something he did at work, but has slowly crept into everyday life; including at home with the family, although his two year old struggles with the concept of limiting ‘work in progress’ or as we call it ‘toys in play’.\n\nHe started as a developer, but when he moved to a team experimenting with Scrum, the Scrum Master role was one he really enjoyed. After a year he transitioned to Agile Champion for the wider line of business within a year and was coaching teams across the globe with their first tentative steps into the Agile world.\n\nA deep passion for creating safe, trusted and empowered teams has been developed over the years. While also aiding them to strip back Agile to its principles has meant the teams can grow and really become Agile, instead of just doing Agile.\n\nYou’ll find him at various local meetups trying to both share what he knows and learn from his peers.",

Her passion is to collect and share best industry and company practices in Agile management. She helps Agile teams and programmes to improve their processes and implement the transition from Waterfall to Agile in corporate environments (her clients are major banks and very large companies from other industries).\n\nAdditionally Anna Obukhova is using neuroscience and biology to explain Agile productivity and enhance Agile coaching techniques. This perspective of Neuroscience and Agile was agreed to be novel and worth sharing by many conferences, to name a few: ALE Bucharest, Agile Days Moscow, Global Scrum Gathering Paris, Agile Cambridge, Agile Tour London, Agile on the Beach 2017, 2018 (UK), Agile 2017 (Orlando, USA) Agile 2018 (San Diego), Agile Business Conference 2017, 2018 (Moscow), Global Scrum Gathering Dublin, Manage Agile (Berlin), Scrum Gathering Rio.\n\nShe uses her educations in Biology, Psychology and Coaching to connect working tips and recommendations with the natural processes that happen in our bodies (especially in the brain). She believes it can explain a lot and she`s very excited how naturally Agile works.",

She left this career at the end of 2017 and sought out a trainee role that would allow har access to software development and data analysis.\n\nErin loves logic, loves solving problems and loves understanding things.\n\nSo why did it take her so long to make the move? Part of it was a fear of a toxic culture, a sense that serious work in computing wasn’t “for” her. As two of my brothers entered the field and became successful, she hung back – despite knowing how similar her skill set was to theirs (seriously, Sunday dinners were all about solving puzzles and Victorian parlour games in our house).\n\nAnd what else? Not much. Right now, she is learning and generating new ideas about what to be curious about next every day.\n\nCritical Thinking, creativity, logic, proof, problem-solving, puzzling, gaming, call it what you will… Erin believes that there’s a shared curiosity to people who bring new ideas into the world, and she wants be a part of it; and will be a part of it.\n\nShe brings her unique perspective, and the concepts that she’s familiar with that others might not be, and integrates them into meaningful, and useful ideas.\n\n“Two things I can always promise: I have an opinion about that, and I’ll share it with you.”",

As part of his role, he is passionate about finding the best tools and techniques to optimise team culture, ways of working and solution design.\n\nHe considers projects that follow classic waterfall/big design up-front practices to be too likely to be doomed to go anywhere near them, and will also stay away from transformation projects that are solely based on coaching. But he has and will happily help organisations transform via practical involvement and by example.\n\nOutside of work, Marcel is interested in sci-fi and comic books, Theravada Buddhist meditation and number theory.

His personal mission is to do the hard work to make beautiful exciting ideas simple and accessible enough for anyone to understand and appreciate.\n\nHe was active in London’s tech scene, and led the London Python meetup group, doubling its membership to 4000. He moved to Cornwall earlier in 2018 and is developing a data science community, and runs a monthly kids code club. He continues to run a successful algorithmic art group across London and Cornwall.\n\nWhenever he can, he loves organising community events, teaching and mentoring. He loves open source, and was lucky enough to lead on open source reform for the UK Government. His current focus is creative coding for kids and artists who’ve never coded before, and his next book on text mining.\n\nIt’s sometimes hard to tell, but he has a masters degree in machine learning and data mining, and started using Python in the last century.",
